# UberDataAnalysis

This repo is for a sample pyspark project of transforming and analysing Uber NYC Data.
We took rough raw data from NYC Website containing very rough data.
We get data in parquet file, read parquet file in pyspark dataframe.
Created a data model for Uber Trip Fair data analysis.
Created multiple tables from one parquest file.
Created one main fact table from that newly created tables.
Stored that new dataframe into postgresql.
Connected Power BI with PostgreSql.
Generated a report.


This project is mainly to see the pyspark transformations, not for data analysis.
